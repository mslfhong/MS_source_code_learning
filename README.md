# MS_source_code_learning
In order to learn source code of pre bigbang ms, I'm a fan of MS through out these years

I'm just a big fan of old MS and TODAY(2022.5.6) I want to dig into the source code of old MS and I found this GIT: https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS, I'm quit thrilled and buckle up to learn through it ,in on way, I can improve my coding skills, in another, maybe(thank god if I can) I can found some "bugs" and to improve them!
